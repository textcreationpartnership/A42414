            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS to this little Treati≈øe (the <hi>≈ømallne≈øs</hi> whereof would ea≈øily be excus'd, if it were not al≈øo of it ≈øelf <hi>imperfect,</hi> as de≈øign'd in order only to ≈øome other thing) I de≈øire the Reader to take this following account. It is now more than four Years ago, ≈øince I wrote an <hi>Expo≈øition</hi> on the fourth and fifth Chapters of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> and communicated it to ≈øome certain Friends, whom I thought be≈øt able to make a right Judgment of it; who, for the most part, mode≈øtly excu≈øing their unacquaintedne≈øs with the≈øe Studies, advis'd me to impart it to the famous Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> To him therefore I di≈øpatch'd it; who, quite contrary to what I imagin'd, finding very little to ≈øay again≈øt the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars</hi> of my Expo≈øition, ≈øet him≈øelf wholly to overthrow the very <hi>Foundation</hi> on which I built; and which I thought ≈øo plain, that no body could have oppos'd it. In ≈øhort, the main, and (in effect) the only things that he objected, were the contrary Propo≈øitions to what I here a≈ø≈øert in the≈øe Papers.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, about the end of <hi>February 1685/6.</hi> I put forth the fir≈øt of the≈øe three Sheets; wherein I prove from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Title</hi> pre≈øixt to tho≈øe very Chapters by the Spirit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, that <hi>they are properly a Prophecy of things to come to pa≈øs after St.</hi> John's <hi>receiving the Vi≈øion;</hi> which Dr. <hi>M.</hi> with great earne≈øtne≈øs had denied in the <hi>xxi≈øt</hi> Chapter of his <hi>Paralipomena Prophetica</hi> (a Book which he put forth about <hi>November 1685,</hi> after he had ≈øeen my Expo≈øition) but he had never taken notice, that the <hi>SPIRIT</hi> him≈øelf has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øly entitled it <hi>a Vi≈øion of future things,</hi> which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb facs="tcp:29464:3"/>a very great Over≈øight in the Doctor. So I thought that my putting him in mind of this, would ea≈øily put an end to the Di≈øpute between us; there being nothing to be ≈øaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt ≈øo plain a Demon≈øtration. And indeed my Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did not fail me, for from that time to this, I have never had a word of An≈øwer from him; which, in effect, was yielding up the whole to me, that I contend for in the≈øe Papers. For if tho≈øe Chapters be <hi>A Prophecy of things to come to pa≈øs after St.</hi> John's <hi>receiving of the Vi≈øion,</hi> they were not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pa≈øt, or pre≈øent, at that time. And con≈øequently, the <hi>Opening</hi> of the ≈øealed Book, which St. <hi>John</hi> then ≈øaw, mu≈øt be a Type of the <hi>explaining</hi> of it afterwards (for it prefigures that mo≈øt naturally, and can prefigure nothing el≈øe) and al≈øo the <hi>Throne</hi> which he ≈øaw at the ≈øame time, mu≈øt needs be a Throne of God which was <hi>afterwards</hi> to be on <hi>Earth,</hi> and cannot ≈øignify his Throne in the highe≈øt <hi>Heaven,</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øted before all Ages. Altho to make all as ≈øure as I could, I have prov'd the≈øe things by many other Arguments in the≈øe Papers. It is therefore highly to be pre≈øum'd that the Doctor would in all this time have defended his Book again≈øt that fir≈øt attempt of mine, if it had been po≈ø≈øible; but ≈øince he has not done it, we may well conclude, that as his Mode≈øty would not ≈øuffer him to <hi>confe≈øs</hi> his Error, otherwi≈øe than by Silence, ≈øo it would much le≈øs allow him to engage in <hi>defence</hi> of it. I lately hear, that ≈øince (<hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Augu≈øt</hi> la≈øt) God has taken him to his Mercy; and let his Memory be ever precious. I hope it will be no Offence to tho≈øe that have a ju≈øt e≈øteem for it, if, before I publi≈øh my ≈øaid Expo≈øition to the World, I undertake to clear tho≈øe Points in difference between us, upon which I am to lay ≈øo great a ≈øtre≈øs; and which if I am not able to make good, it would be vain to meddle any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this bu≈øine≈øs.</p>

               <hi>A</hi> VINDICATION <hi>of certain Papers (not yet made publick) concerning the Expo≈øition of the fourth and fifth Chapters of the</hi> Revelation, <hi>(the right under≈øtanding of which Chapters would be of the greate≈øt advantage to the Church:) from the Exceptions of the Reverend and Learned Dr.</hi> H. M.</head>
            <p>THere is no Vi≈øion in the whole Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> that has been le≈øs under≈øtood hitherto, than that of the <hi>4th</hi> and <hi>5th</hi> Chapters; and yet there is none has been expounded with more ea≈øe to tho≈øe that have undertaken that Task, than tho≈øe Chapters have. For tho there be many Objections both very weighty, and very obvious, to be made again≈øt the Expo≈øitions of every one of them (for they all agree as to the main, in a literal kind of way of interpreting them (≈øuch as any Child that is but ju≈øt come to the u≈øe of Rea≈øon, would be apt at fir≈øt ≈øight to pitch upon) concurring unanimou≈øly in one grand mi≈øtake, That by the Lamb's coming and taking the Book out of the hand of him that ≈øat on the Throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. is repre≈øented God's giving his Son the Revelation; tho there be many Objections, I ≈øay, both weighty and obvious, to be alledg'd again≈øt this way of expounding, yet no Man, tho never ≈øo learned, ingenious, or curious in the≈øe Speculations, has ≈øo much as mention'd one of them, till the learned and ingenious Dr. <hi>M.</hi> being urg'd by ≈øome Papers I ≈øent him a while ago, has been pleas'd both to in≈øert the Objections into his <hi>Paralipomena Prophetica,</hi> Chap. xxxiv. and to give us his Solutions of them. It is a glorious Vi≈øion, as any one may ≈øee by the bare letter of it; which made me, while I look'd upon it only by the Light which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from others, never to read it over without a Sigh. For I could perceive nothing from their Expo≈øitions, but what is deliver'd much more plainly in other Scriptures: and I could not by any
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29464:4"/>means per≈øwade my ≈øelf that ≈øo magnificent a Vi≈øion as this is, was written only to inform us, how ob≈øcurely and my≈øteriou≈øly common Truths, well kown before, plain, ea≈øy, and familiar, might be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented.</p>
            <p>I hope no Man will be ≈øo uncharitable as to interpret the de≈øign of what I have here ≈øaid, to be as if I meant to di≈øparage other Interpreters, to mo≈øt of whom for any commendable Quality I am no way comparable. For as I honour every Man that with ≈øo much as but a good intent has ≈øeem'd to have be≈øtowed his pains in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating the≈øe My≈øteries: ≈øo I ingenuou≈øly profe≈øs that nothing but the love of Truth has mov'd me to lay open the ≈øeeming Incon≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtencies of their Expo≈øition. In order to the manife≈øting of which Truth, when it ≈øhall be thought fit by tho≈øe that are the Judges of what is fit in ≈øuch ca≈øes; I ≈øhall now only endeavour to prepare the way, by ≈øhewing that which the Reverend and Learned Dr. <hi>M.</hi> is forced to deny at any rate, as being utterly incon≈øi≈øtent with his own and the common Hypothe≈øis, <hi>viz. That the Vi≈øion of the fourth and fifth Chapters of the Revelation is properly a Prophecy; and con≈øequently, that the de≈øign of the fifth Chapter is not to repre≈øent God's giving to his Son the Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the fourth and fifth Chapters of the</hi> Revelation <hi>are a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</hi> This appears ≈øo plainly from the Preface that the Spirit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf has prefixt to them, that one would think it impo≈ø≈øible for any Man to be mi≈øtaken in this Point. <hi>After this I looked</hi> (≈øays St. <hi>John,</hi> Chap. iv. 1.) <hi>and behold a Door was opened in Heaven; And the fir≈øt Voice which I heard was as it were of a Trumpet talking with me, ≈øaying, Come up hither, and I will ≈øhew thee things which mu≈øt be hereafter.</hi> Is not this as plain an Indication as can be de≈øired, that the things which St. <hi>John</hi> was now about to ≈øee, were things to come; and con≈øequently, that the ≈øeeing of tho≈øe things is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe≈øying? But what were tho≈øe things which the Voice ≈øhewed him? What can they be, if not tho≈øe which immediately follow, of which St. <hi>John</hi> gives this Relation, ver. 2, 3, &amp;c. <hi>And immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> ≈øays he, <hi>I was in the Spirit, and behold, a Throne was ≈øet in Heaven; and one ≈øat on the Throne, &amp;c. And round about the Throne were four and twenty Elders ≈øitting,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and out of the Throne proceeded Lightnings, and Thundrings, and Voices; And there were ≈øeven Lamps of Fire burning before the Throne,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And in the mid≈øt of the Throne, and round about the Throne were four Bea≈øts, &amp;c.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29464:4"/>who re≈øt not day and night, ≈øaying, Holy, Holy Holy, &amp;c.</hi> And when tho≈øe Bea≈øts magnify him that ≈øate on the Throne, the four and twenty Elders with profound humility give God the Glory of the Works of his Creation. Then in the fifth Chapter he proceeds to tell us how that the <hi>Sitter on the Throne had a Book in his right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, written within, and on the back-≈øide, ≈øealed with ≈øeven Seals.</hi> Whereupon <hi>a ≈øtrong Angel</hi> is ≈øeen <hi>proclaiming with a loud Voice, Who is worthy to open the Book? &amp;c.</hi> ver≈ø. 1, 2. <hi>None in the whole World is found worthy,</hi> ver≈ø. 3. Wherefore St. <hi>John weeps,</hi> ver. 4. <hi>One of the Elders comforts him,</hi> ver. 5. Whereupon St. <hi>John</hi> e≈øpies <hi>in the mid≈øt of the Throne a Lamb ≈øtanding as if it had been ≈ølain, &amp;c.</hi> ver. 6. who <hi>came and took the Book out of the right-hand of him that ≈øate on the Throne,</hi> ver. 7. Upon which the ≈øaid <hi>Bea≈øts and Elders fall down before the Lamb, and ≈øing a Song</hi> to him, congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulating his taking the Book, and opening the Seals, ver. 8, 9, 10. Then the Prophet hears the Voice of <hi>many Angels round about the Throne, and the Bea≈øts, and the Elders applauding the Lamb,</hi> ver. 11, 12. And next he hears no le≈øs than <hi>every Creature in Heaven, Earth, Sea, and under the Earth, giving Ble≈ø≈øing, Honour, Glory and Power to him that ≈øitteth on the Throne, and to the Lamb.</hi> The <hi>four Bea≈øts</hi> ≈øaying <hi>Amen;</hi> and the <hi>Elders</hi> doing mo≈øt profound reverence al≈øo, <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13. ‚Äî Then he proceeds in Chap. vi. 1, 2, &amp;c. to tell us what he ≈øaw in the Book when the Lamb had opened it. <hi>And I ≈øaw</hi> (≈øays St. <hi>John) when the Lamb opened one of the Seals, and I heard as it were the noi≈øe of Thunder; one of the four Bea≈øts ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Come and ≈øee. And I ≈øaw, and behold a white Hor≈øe, and he that ≈øat on him had a Bow,</hi> &amp;c. And in like manner he goes on, de≈øcribing what he ≈øaw at the opening of each Sea. ‚Äî Now the thing which I affirm is this, That whether the things which St. <hi>John</hi> ≈øaw in the Book, be a Prophecy of future things or not; yet it mu≈øt needs be that the many other things which he ≈øaw and heard before the opening of the Book, are a Prophecy. The rea≈øon is plain; becau≈øe tho≈øe words of the Voice [Chap. 4.1. <hi>I will ≈øhew thee things that mu≈øt be hereafter</hi>] do mo≈øt plainly and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affect the things which he ≈øaw in the fourth and fifth Chapters; but not tho≈øe things which he ≈øaw in the Book, Chap. 6. Nor does this only appear from the order of Narration, but al≈øo from the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon and nature of the the thing it ≈øelf. For tho≈øe words of the Voice [<hi>Come up hither, and I will ≈øhew thee things that mu≈øt be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29464:5"/>hereafter</hi>] mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily refer to the things which the <hi>Voice</hi> ≈øhew'd him, <hi>viz.</hi> tho≈øe things which he ≈øaw by virtue of his being call'd up into Heaven; which things are plainly <hi>the Throne,</hi> with <hi>the Sitter on it,</hi> together with the other things afore-≈øpoken of. But as for the things that were contained in the <hi>Book,</hi> he was not ≈øhew'd them by the <hi>Voice,</hi> but by the <hi>Lamb</hi> that opened the Book, and the <hi>Bea≈øts</hi> that called him to ≈øee them; as appears mo≈øt evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.1, 2, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides, the Title of [<hi>things that mu≈øt be hereafter</hi>] is not ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the Vi≈øions of the ≈øealed Book; who≈øe Events (even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Dr. <hi>M</hi>'s own Expo≈øition) begin as ≈øoon as tho≈øe of the Epi≈øtolar Prophecy. As therefore the Title to the Epi≈øtolar Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is [<hi>things that are, and things that mu≈øt be hereafter,</hi> Rev. 1.19.] becau≈øe, as the Doctor truly affirms, the Epi≈øtles concern the ≈øtate of the Church then pre≈øent, as well as that which was to come; why ≈øhould not the Prophecy of the ≈øealed Book have the ≈øame Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, ≈øince the rea≈øon in all points is the ≈øame? So plain is it every way, that tho≈øe words of the Voice <hi>[Come up hither, and I will ≈øhew thee things which mu≈øt be hereafter]</hi> re≈øpect not the Vi≈øions of the Book, Chap. 6. but tho≈øe that immediately follow the ≈øaid words in Chap. 4.2, 3, <hi>&amp;c. viz.</hi> the Vi≈øion of the Throne, and the re≈øt that follow.</p>
            <p>If therefore the Vi≈øion of the <hi>Throne,</hi> with the <hi>Sitter on it,</hi> the <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Bea≈øts</hi> prai≈øing him, the <hi>Book</hi> in the Sitter's Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, the <hi>≈øtrong Angels proclaiming,</hi> &amp;c. I ≈øay, if the≈øe things be not ≈øome of tho≈øe which the Voice points at, <hi>Ver≈ø.</hi> 1. telling the Prophet he would ≈øhew him <hi>things that mu≈øt come to pa≈øs hereafter,</hi> it will be impo≈ø≈øible to prove that any part of the <hi>Revelation</hi> is a Prophecy. <hi>Come up hither</hi> (≈øays the Voice) <hi>and I will ≈øhew thee things that mu≈øt be hereafter. And immediately</hi> (≈øays the Prophet) <hi>I was in the Spirit, and ≈øaw</hi> ≈øuch and ≈øuch things. And are not they the things then which the Voice ≈øaid he would ≈øhew him? Which things, ≈øince the Voice ≈øays they are future things, or <hi>things that mu≈øt be hereafter;</hi> it is plain the Vi≈øion of them is a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwith≈øtanding this mighty Evidence of Truth, the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Dr. <hi>M.</hi> is plea≈øed to expre≈øs his <hi>Wonder</hi> (in his <hi>Paralipomena Prophetica,</hi> Chap. xxi.) <hi>that any Man of Wit, and Parts, and Learning ≈øhould be ≈øo heedle≈øs and gro≈øly mi≈øtaken, as to make it a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29464:5"/>Prophecy properly ≈øo called,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas he that has but the lea≈øt judgment in the World, mu≈øt needs ≈øee (if he will not wilfully wink) that the Spirit him≈øelf ≈øtiles it a Vi≈øion of <hi>things to come:</hi> And therefore if the Spirit ≈øpeaks <hi>properly,</hi> the Vi≈øion is <hi>properly a Prophecy.</hi> But let us hear what that Learned Per≈øon urges in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his own Opinion. Now the ≈øub≈øtance of what he alledges in the ≈øaid Chapter is this: <q>That the Vi≈øion of the fourth and fifth Chapters of the <hi>Revelation</hi> is no more a Prophecy, than that in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> the fir≈øt; to which al≈øo it is very like in many re≈øpects: as that of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is to the glorious Repre≈øentation of the God of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> made to <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> and the Elders in the Mount, <hi>Exod.</hi> xxiv. wherefore as neither that which <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> or <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> ≈øaw, was a Prophecy: So neither is it likely that that which St. <hi>John</hi> ≈øaw is a Prophecy. It is only, or chiefly intended for an <hi>Introductory Vi≈øion</hi> to the Prophecy of the ≈øealed Book, which begins Chap. 6.1. (a thing u≈øual with the Prophets, as may be ≈øeen <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 6.1, 2. &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. <hi>Daniel.</hi> 10.5, &amp;c.) and no more a Prophecy than tho≈øe in <hi>I≈øaiah, Ezekiel,</hi> or <hi>Daniel</hi> are, intimating the Divine In≈øpiration of <hi>John</hi> in writing tho≈øe Prophecies, and ≈øetting forth that in pompous and magnificent Expre≈ø≈øions, which is noted in a more vulgar ≈øtile, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.1. <hi>viz.</hi> That God gave his Son the Revelation.</q> To this I an≈øwer; It is here taken for granted that the Vi≈øion which <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ≈øaw in the places afore-cited, is not a Prophecy; which ought to be clearly proved before any ≈øtre≈øs can be laid upon it. But ≈øuppo≈øe it to be no Prophecy (for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ≈øpare time for cavilling) will it thence follow that the Vi≈øion of <hi>Rev.</hi> iv. &amp; v. is no Prophecy, only becau≈øe in ≈øome things it agrees with that Vi≈øion of <hi>Ezekiel, i. e.</hi> it ≈øeems to borrow ≈øome of its Types from thence? Are not all Interpereters generally agreed, that the Types in the <hi>Revelation</hi> are mo≈øtly borrowed from Stories, Rites, and Con≈øtitutions of the Jewi≈øh Church, and taken out of the Old Te≈øtament, as well the Hi≈øtorical as Prophetical Parts of it, and yet no Man denies it to be a Prophecy? For Example, do not both Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> and your ≈øelf al≈øo in ≈øeveral Particulars re≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Prophecy of the Woman, <hi>Rev.</hi> xii. 1, &amp;c. to the Hi≈øtory of the Children of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and coming out of it, <hi>Exod.</hi> i. and in the following Chapter? And yet you never doubt of its being a Prophecy ere the more for that.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:29464:6"/>
            <p>But further, There is a va≈øt difference between the Vi≈øion of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> and that of St. <hi>John, Rev.</hi> iv. &amp; v. in that this latter is entitled by the Spirit him≈øelf, [a Vision] <hi>of things that mu≈øt be hereafter.</hi> Now if the≈øe, or the like words be not prefix'd to that Vi≈øion of <hi>Ezekiel, Mo≈øes,</hi> or that of <hi>Daniel</hi> either afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, how can it be thought good rea≈øoning, to ≈øay, tho≈øe Vi≈øions are no Prophecies, therefore this is none?</p>
            <p>I expected the Doctor ≈øhould have clear'd this point, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Argument hitherto in≈øi≈øted on from tho≈øe obvious words, <hi>Come up hither, and I will ≈øhew thee things that mu≈øt be hereafter;</hi> which are the mo≈øt appo≈øite in the World to prove the Vi≈øion immediately ≈øub≈øequent, to be a Prophecy) but I find not the lea≈øt notice taken of it.</p>
            <p>But becau≈øe the Doctor in≈øi≈øts much upon its being an <hi>Introducto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Vi≈øion</hi> to tho≈øe of the ≈øealed Book; as if it could be no Prophecy, if it were an Introductory Vi≈øion.</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer, by granting it to be an Introductory Vi≈øion indeed; but no otherwi≈øe Introductory, than the Prophecy of the Sealed-Book introduces that of the Trumpets, <hi>Chap.</hi> viii. or than that does the Prophecy of the Opened-Book (as the Doctor loves to call it) <hi>Chap.</hi> xi. 1, &amp;c. Or than the Vi≈øion of the Vials, <hi>Chap.</hi> xvi. intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces that of the Bea≈øt, <hi>Chap.</hi> xvii. As one <hi>Hi≈øtory</hi> may introduce another; ≈øo one <hi>Prophecy</hi> may introduce another; What ≈øhould hinder? But now, If by an <hi>Introductory Vi≈øion</hi> be meant a <hi>Preface;</hi> there is no other ≈øuch as I ≈øee, than that of Chap. iv. 1. where the Voice calls St. <hi>John</hi> to him, ≈øaying, <hi>Come up hither, and I will ≈øhew thee things that mu≈øt be hereafter.</hi> This I ≈øay is all the <hi>Preface</hi> that I can find; for in the very next Ver≈øe begins an account of the things them≈øelves, which the Voice promis'd to ≈øhew him; <hi>viz.</hi> a Prophetical Repre≈øentation of a glorious Church, with a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular De≈øcription (in the likene≈øs of an Hi≈øtory) of the Beginning, Progre≈øs, and Accompli≈øhment of the Opening of a certain Book, who≈øe Contents are particularly de≈øcribed, Chap. vi. and tho≈øe that follow. So that here is <hi>Prophetia in Propheti√¢, i. e.</hi> the Prophecy of the <hi>Book</hi> it ≈øelf, contained in the Prophetical Relation of the <hi>opening</hi> of it. As if it had been ≈øaid thus: Hereafter ≈øhall ari≈øe a Church like that de≈øcribed <hi>Rev.</hi> iv. wherein a certain Book ≈øhall be open'd by the Lamb, in ≈øuch manner and circum≈øtances as are de≈øcribed, Chap. v. containing ≈øuch and ≈øuch things as are ≈øaid to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29464:6"/>have been ≈øeen in it in the ≈øixth and following Chapters. Now in ≈øuch manner of ≈øpeech as this, who does not ≈øee that the De≈øcription of the Church, and the manner of opening the Book is <hi>introductory</hi> of the things contained in the Book; and yet is as properly a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as that contained in the Book is? To which Prophetical Hi≈øtory of the opening of this Book, tho≈øe words, <hi>[Come up hither, and I will ≈øhew thee things that mu≈øt be hereafter</hi> is the only Preface. By which, and by his adding immediately after, that <hi>he was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately in the Spirit,</hi> upon the ≈øpeaking of the≈øe words to him; St. <hi>John</hi>'s Divine In≈øpiration in writing this Prophecy, is ≈øufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimated.</p>
            <p>But whereas the Learned Doctor further a≈ø≈øerts, That the fifth Chapter is added, <hi>for the ≈øetting forth of that in more pompous and magnificent Expre≈ø≈øions, which is done but in a vulgar ≈øtile,</hi> Rev. i. 1. that <hi>God gave his Son the Revelation:</hi> this being a Stone that mo≈øt Interpreters have ≈øtumbled at, I endeavoured to remove it by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding ≈øeveral things, the attentive Con≈øideration of which would give great light to this whole matter in di≈øpute. And the Doctor has done me the honour to ≈øet down the Queries them≈øelves, as he had them from me in Manu≈øcript, with his An≈øwers to them, in the 34th Chapter of his <hi>Paralipomena.</hi> Which An≈øwers, tho I am not at all ≈øatisfied with, unle≈øs it be that I am much the more confirm'd by them in my former Opinion: Yet I ≈øhall not here be≈øtow that needle≈øs pains of ≈øhewing the in≈øufficiency of them. For ≈øo long as that A≈ø≈øertion ≈øtands good, which I have been hitherto proving, <hi>viz.</hi> That the fourth and fifth Chapters of the <hi>Revelation</hi> are a Prophecy of things to come to pa≈øs <hi>hereafter,</hi> it cannot be that they ≈øhould be taken up in ≈øetting forth God's giving to his Son the <hi>Revelation;</hi> which was done <hi>before.</hi> Notwith≈øtanding, Sir, if you do not think that I have clear'd this Point ≈øufficiently yet; if you de≈øire it, I will make it my next bu≈øine≈øs, God willing, to give you all the ≈øati≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction I can, by ≈øhewing one by one that my Queries, or Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, do ≈øtill remain in their full force, notwith≈øtanding all that you have ≈øaid to them. But I would not willingly engage ≈øo deep again≈øt a Per≈øon, for whom I have ≈øo ≈øingular an e≈øteem.

            <head>II. <hi>That by opening the ≈øealed Book,</hi> Rev. v. <hi>is meant</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining it. <hi>And that by the</hi> Throne <hi>there, is meant a Throne of God on</hi> Earth, <hi>and not in the highe≈øt</hi> Heaven.</head>
            <p>HAving prov'd in the former Sheet, That the Vi≈øion of the fourth and fifth Chapters of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> is properly a Prophecy of things that were to come to pa≈øs after the exhibiting of it to St. <hi>John</hi> (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding what has been alledg'd to the contrary by the Learned Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi>) I proceed now to ≈øhew, concerning the other Points in di≈øpute between us,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> That by that Phra≈øe of opening the ≈øealed Book, ≈øo often us'd <hi>Rev.</hi> v. is meant or prefigur'd the explaining of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That by the Throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> iv. 2, &amp;c. is prefigur'd ≈øome Throne of God on Earth, and not his Throne in the highe≈øt Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> That by opening the Sealed Book is meant, or prefigur'd the explaining of it. For the truth of this Propo≈øition, I appealed to the con≈øtant and unque≈øtionable u≈øe of that Phra≈øe of opening a Sealed Book, where-ever it occurs throughout the Scripture. As <hi>Dan.</hi> ix. 24. <hi>Seal up the Vi≈øion</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> that it be not opened) and xii. 4. <hi>Seal the Book even to the time of the end.</hi> Al≈øo by the ≈øealed Book, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> xxix. 11. is meant a Book which no Man could open, or under≈øtand. Al≈øo that opening of Prophecies ≈øignifies explaining them, appears from <hi>Luke</hi> xxiv. 32. where Chri≈øt is ≈øaid to have opened the Scriptures; and <hi>Acts</hi> xvii. 3. St. <hi>Paul</hi> is ≈øaid to have opened and alledg'd (<hi>viz.</hi> out of the Prophecies of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) that Chri≈øt mu≈øt needs have ≈øuffer'd. Whence the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is plain, That if by Sealing a Prophecy be con≈øtantly meant in Scripture concealing the Sen≈øe of it, ≈øo that altho it be written, and in every Man's Hand, yet none knows what it means; and if on the other ≈øide, by opening a Prophecy con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd as ≈øealed or my≈øterious, be con≈øtantly meant explaining it; it is all the rea≈øon in the World, that it ≈øhould be ≈øo expounded
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29464:8"/>in the place we are upon, as it is in all other places.</p>
            <p>To this the Doctor an≈øwers in the xxxiii Chap. of his <hi>Par. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetica,</hi> by di≈øtingui≈øhing between opening a Book, and opening a Text. To open a Book, is to uncla≈øp it; to open the Text, is to explain it. And thus it is one thing to open a ≈øealed Book where the Prophecy is, and another to open a ≈øealed Prophecy; which is evident from <hi>Luke</hi> iv. 17. where <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, which ≈øometimes ≈øignifies to explain, ≈øignifies only to open a Book of Prophecies, or to expo≈øe the Writing to view; which, ≈øays the Doctor, is the ca≈øe here of the ≈øeven-≈øealed Book, as appears from <hi>Rev.</hi> vi. where the opening of the Seals is exemplified, and the meaning ≈øhew'd to be only the exhibiting to <hi>John</hi> ≈øo many particular Vi≈øions, but not the explaining of tho≈øe Vi≈øions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. The Lamb is ≈øaid <hi>Rev.</hi> vi. not barely to have opened the Book, but to have opened the Seals of it. Now the Seals of a Book are always upon the Text; for we no where read of a Book ≈øealed any otherwi≈øe than in re≈øpect to the my≈øteriou≈øne≈øs of it. The Seals of a Book are not ≈øuch as may be broken with the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or cut off with a Knife, or mall'd with an Hammer (if the ≈øeven Epi≈øtles indeed had been ≈øaid to have been ≈øealed, we might have had more rea≈øon to have fancied them ≈øuch) but which yield only to the judgment and under≈øtanding of the pious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, through the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the Spirit of God. And this the Doctor grants, while he ≈øhews him≈øelf very willing, but as little able, to produce one in≈øtance to the contrary. But now if the Seals be always upon the Text, then the Lamb's opening of the Seals in the Vi≈øion, mu≈øt needs figure the opening of the Text, which the Doctor grants to be explaining the ≈øen≈øe of it. And (≈øince I have before proved the Vi≈øion to be a Prophecy) it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from hence that it is a Prophecy concerning the explaining of the ≈øealed Book; in which the Lamb opening the Seals to St. <hi>John,</hi> and ≈øhewing him the in≈øide Writing, is a Type of Chri≈øt, or of his Church, that ≈øhould afterwards explain the meaning of it to the Faithful. 2. The Doctor in his <hi>Apoc. Apocalyp≈øeos</hi> on <hi>Rev.</hi> v. 1. grants the Seals of the Book to ≈øignify its <hi>Arcana;</hi> and whereas the Book is ≈øaid to have been written within and on the back-≈øide, the Doctor there expounds the in≈øide Writing to be the <hi>inward Sen≈øe</hi> of the Book, in oppo≈øition to the literal ≈øen≈øe, which is the back-≈øide writing. Whence it mu≈øt undeniably follow, That to open the Seals of the Book, ≈øo that the in≈øide-writing may be ≈øeen, is to ≈øhew the inward ≈øen≈øe of it; or, which is all one, to explain it.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:29464:8"/>
            <p>Wherefore as to what the Doctor ≈øays of the Lamb's opening the Seals <hi>Rev.</hi> vi. that it is only the exhibiting certain Vi≈øions to St. <hi>John,</hi> but not explaining them (from whence he peremptorily concludes, that whatever in other places may be meant by opening the Seals of a Book, it cannot be under≈øtood here of explaining it); I an≈øwer, The Doctor to maintain a literal ≈øen≈øe of this Phra≈øe of opening a ≈øealed Book (the ≈øen≈øe which he is ≈øo zealous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt in other ca≈øes) is pleas'd to make him≈øelf extremely igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in a point of ordinary cognizance. For why, I be≈øeech you, Sir, may not Chri≈øt's explaining the inward ≈øen≈øe of this Book at ≈øome time or other to his Servants, be fore-≈øignified by the Lamb's opening the Seals of it in the Vi≈øion and ≈øhewing the in≈øide-writing of it to St. <hi>John?</hi> The Doctor grants the Lamb to repre≈øent Chri≈øt; St. <hi>John</hi> to repre≈øent the People of God (upon <hi>Rev.</hi> v. 4.) he grants the in≈øide-writing of the Book to ≈øignify the inward ≈øen≈øe of it (in the place a little afore quoted.) What is it then that he denies? Why, tho he grants all this ≈øingly, yet he denies, when put together, that the Lamb's opening the Seals and ≈øhewing the in≈øide-writing to St. <hi>John,</hi> ≈øignifies Chri≈øt's explaining at ≈øome time or other to his People the inward Sen≈øe of the Book. Which, how unrea≈øonable a thing it is, I leave to the judgment of any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Reader.</p>
            <p>It is therefore to me one of the greate≈øt Wonders in the World, that the Doctor who cries up the <hi>Apocalyps for a Book ≈øo throughly ≈øymbolical,</hi> that he will by no means allow <hi>Hail-≈øtones or Earthquakes to be interpreted literally</hi> (See <hi>Par, Proph.</hi> Chap. xlviii. p. 444.) ≈øhould be here ≈øo ≈øtiff for the literal ≈øen≈øe of opening the Seals of a Prophetick Book, which (as God would have it) has no literal ≈øen≈øe at all. But certainly one would be ≈øurpriz'd, who has heard to what a degree the Doctor both derides and pities <hi>R.H.</hi> of <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> (Epilogue to <hi>Apoc. Apocalyp≈øeos,</hi> p. 297.) for doting on the literal ≈øen≈øe of the <hi>Apocalyp≈øe,</hi> to ≈øind him caught in the ≈øame ≈ønare him≈øelf, and become as zealous an <hi>R. H‚Äîian</hi> as the Gentleman he oppos'd, even in a Type or Symbol which is never known to have been us'd in ≈øuch a ≈øen≈øe. For a further Confirmation of the Sen≈øe of which Phra≈øe, I will in≈øtance but in one plain ca≈øe, which we have <hi>Dan.</hi> xii. 4. where the Prophet is commanded to ≈øeal the Book even to the time of the end. For if opening the Seals of a Book be no more than expo≈øing, the bare words (without ≈øen≈øe) to view; how can the Book of <hi>Daniel</hi> be ≈øaid to have been ≈øealed to the time of the end, when the words of it have been vi≈øible from
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29464:9"/>the time of his receiving them? If you ≈øay, That opening the Seals of a Book may ≈øignify only expo≈øing the bare words tho not in that place of <hi>Daniel:</hi> I de≈øire but what is very fair, That you would ≈øhew me then ≈øome other place, where the Phra≈øe ≈øignifies what you contend; or el≈øe confe≈øs that you have err'd about it.</p>
            <p>But if it could be ≈øhew'd (which I believe can never be) that opening the Seals of a Book is ≈øomewhere found to have a literal ≈øen≈øe; yet ≈øuch a ≈øen≈øe not only would be di≈ø≈øonant from the ≈øtile and genius of the <hi>Apocalyp≈øe,</hi> but in the Vi≈øion we are now upon, impo≈ø≈øible to be true. For in the literal ≈øen≈øe the Seals were open'd by the Lamb in the pre≈øence of St. <hi>John</hi> 1600 Years ago, at the time of his ≈øeeing this Vi≈øion; whereas I have before manife≈øtly proved this Vi≈øion to be a Prophecy of things that were to come to pa≈øs after. From whence it follows that the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentations made to St. <hi>John</hi> in it, (whereof that of opening the ≈øealed Book is the mo≈øt in≈øi≈øted on of any) are meerly ≈øymbolical, and to be con≈øider'd only as Images of tho≈øe future things.</p>
            <p>Moreover there are two other things which make the literal ≈øen≈øe of the Seals open'd in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time impo≈ø≈øible. One is, That no ≈øuch loud Proclamation was ever heard before that open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as is expre≈øly ≈øaid to have been made before the true opening of them, <hi>Rev.</hi> v. 2. <hi>I ≈øaw</hi> (≈øays the Prophet) <hi>a ≈øtrong Angel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming with a loud voice; Who is worthy to open the Book, and to loo≈øe the Seals of it?</hi> And this Proclamation is repre≈øented as made in the hearing of all the World, as plainly appears from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn given in upon it in the next Ver≈øe, <hi>viz.</hi> That no Man in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in Earth, or under the Earth, was able to open the Book, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whence we may certainly conclude, that if no Man living in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time did ever hear any ≈øuch Proclamation made, then was not that which is meant by opening of the Seals, tran≈øacted in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time. For it ≈øeems very ab≈øurd to infer that no Man was able to open the Book, becau≈øe upon loud (or publick) Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation made, no Man appear'd to do it, if no Man then in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever heard the Proclamation.</p>
            <p>To this Dr. <hi>M.</hi> an≈øwers, That the Proclamation was never made but only in Vi≈øion (<hi>Par. Proph.</hi> Chap. xxxiv. <hi>Re≈øp. ad prim.</hi>) And he there al≈øo gives this rea≈øon why it was not needful to be fulfill'd, becau≈øe the Vi≈øion is Dramatical, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the nature of a Stage-play. And he explains his Sentiments of the Vi≈øion yet more clearly Chap. xxi. <hi>p.</hi> 189. <hi>lin.</hi> 19. where ≈øpeaking with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect to the Vi≈øion in <hi>Rev.</hi> iv, &amp; v. he tells us that it is the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29464:9"/>of the Angelical Kingdom that they can exhibit Prophetical Shows or Plays, when we Mortals can exhibit only Hi≈øtorical Ones. So that according to this account, the ivth and vth Chapters of the <hi>Revelation</hi> are a Play or Show exhibited by the Angelical Kingdom; and for that rea≈øon there needs be no completion of them.</p>
            <p>To this I reply, 1. That I have prov'd tho≈øe Chapters to be as much a Prophecy, as any part of the <hi>Revelation</hi> can be prov'd to be, and that from the clear Te≈øtimony of the Spirit him≈øelf, who has prefix'd the Title of <hi>Things that mu≈øt be hereafter</hi> to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If <hi>Rev.</hi> iv, &amp; v. be a Play that was really acted in Heaven; I de≈øire to be inform'd, 1. Who acted the Sitter on the Throne, and the ≈ølain Lamb, which are the chief Parts in it. The Doctor tells us (<hi>Par. Proph.</hi> Chap. xxxiv. about the beginning) that by the Sitter on the Throne is meant God, and by the ≈ølain Lamb, Chri≈øt Je≈øus. But it were ab≈øurd to ≈øay, either that they act Plays, or that any Creature acts their Parts. Therefore the Vi≈øion is not Dramatical. 2. It is manife≈øt that tho≈øe under the Earth (by whom the Doctor on the place under≈øtands Wizards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) have a part in this Play too, as may be ≈øeen <hi>Rev.</hi> v. 3, 13. But none of the Angels in Heaven could have ≈øuch a part put upon them, therefore the Vi≈øion is not a Play acted by Angels, but like other Vi≈øions prefigurative of things to come.</p>
            <p>But now as to the rea≈øon why, there needs be no completion of this Vi≈øion, <hi>viz.</hi> becau≈øe it is Dramatical; this is ≈øo far from being a rea≈øon of it, that (if it were true) it would be a good rea≈øon for the quite contrary. For, 1. How can this be a Prophetical Show or Play (as the Doctor calls it) if it be not to be fulfill'd in ≈øome real thing to come? 2. It is the nature of all Plays to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øent real things; ≈øo far is it from all rea≈øon to imagine a Play acted by Angels to be only a Fiction, as the Proclamation we ≈øpeak of mu≈øt needs be, if it were never made, nor to be made, but only in the Vi≈øion. 3. If the Vi≈øion of the Angel proclaiming, needs not to be punctually fulfill'd, as being a part of a Dramatical Vi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ≈øince it is certain and confe≈øt by the Doctor him≈øelf that the Vi≈øion of the opening the Seals (whereof that of the Angel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming, is part) reaches to the end of <hi>Rev.</hi> xi. It will follow that from the fir≈øt mention of the opening of the Seals, <hi>Rev.</hi> v. to the end of the whole Relation of it <hi>Rev.</hi> xi. the Vi≈øions are Dramati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; and therefore need no punctual Completion. So that the Doctor has be≈øtow'd a great deal of pains to little purpo≈øe in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting the Vi≈øions of the Book, <hi>Rev.</hi> vi. when it may be alledg'd,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29464:10"/>that they were exhibited only in a Play or Show, and need no more to be fulfill'd than the Vi≈øion of the ≈øtrong Angel we are ≈øpeaking of.</p>
            <p>The other thing which makes the literal ≈øen≈øe of opening the Book in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time impo≈ø≈øible to be the ultimate ≈øen≈øe of that Phra≈øe, is that which is ≈øaid <hi>Rev.</hi> v. 13. where St. <hi>John</hi> ≈øays he heard every Creature in Heaven, in Earth, in the Sea, and under the Earth, ≈øaying, <hi>Ble≈ø≈øing, and Glory, and Honour, and Power be unto him that ≈øitteth upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever.</hi> In which Hymn ≈øince every Creature was to be concern'd; if it had been ≈øaid in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time, we ≈øhould certainly have had ≈øome foot≈øteps of it in Hi≈øtory. But there is no ≈øuch Pa≈ø≈øage any where to be found, and yet it was to be before the Lamb's opening of the Seals, as plainly appears from the uninterrupted order of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>Rev.</hi> v. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore the true opening of the Seals was not in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time.</p>
            <p>To this the Doctor an≈øwers as ≈øtrangely as to the former (<hi>Par. Proph.</hi> Chap. xxxiv. <hi>Re≈øp. ad</hi> 10.) not re≈øolving whether it was to have any Completion, or not, as being Dramatical too; but if it ought to be fulfill'd at all, he ≈øays it is not to be till the <hi>Millenni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> as neither that before it at <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. where the Bea≈øts and Elders ≈øay, they ≈øhall reign upon the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. The Text it ≈øelf ≈øays, That that Hymn of the Bea≈øts and Elders was ≈øung upon the Lamb's taking of the Book (which Dr. <hi>M.</hi> makes to be in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time) <hi>Rev.</hi> v. 8. <hi>And when the Lamb had taken the Book, they ≈øung,</hi> &amp;c. according to which account it ≈øhould have been pa≈øt the≈øe 1600 Years. Likewi≈øe the Hymn ≈øounded forth by <hi>every Creature</hi> is put before the Lamb's opening any one of the Seals, as is evident to any one that reads. And is it not very ≈øtrange that in the ≈øame uninterrupted Series of Relation, the Lamb's taking the Book <hi>Rev.</hi> v. 7. ≈øhould have been done 1600 Years ago, but that the Song ≈øaid in the next Ver≈øe to have been ≈øung thereupon, ≈øhould not be fulfill'd till the <hi>Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi> as neither the Gratulation of the Angels, <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12. nor the Hymn ≈øaid by every Creature, <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14. And that in the very next Ver≈øe, <hi>viz.</hi> Chap. vi. 1. there ≈øhould be a regre≈ø≈øion to things pa≈øt 1600 Years ago, as the opening of the Book is ≈øaid by Dr. <hi>M.</hi> to be? 2. Whereas the Doctor makes it an Argument, that the Song of the Bea≈øts and Elders, <hi>Chap.</hi> v. 8, 9, 10. ≈øhall not be fulfill'd till the <hi>Millennium,</hi> becau≈øe they ≈øay, they ≈øhall reign upon the Earth; it is plain from tho≈øe words, <hi>≈øhall reign,</hi> that their Reign
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29464:10"/>was not then begun; and con≈øequently, that the Hymn was to be ≈øung before the <hi>Millennium.</hi> 3. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ow arbitrary is it, to make in the ≈øame Vi≈øion, the Bea≈øts and Elders, <hi>Chap.</hi> v. 8. to ≈øigure ≈øomething to come; but the ≈øtrong Angel proclaiming, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. to figure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, (altho in all the Epi≈øtles, and in many other places, the <hi>Angels</hi> of the Churches are by the current of Interpreters expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Men;</hi> and ought to be ≈øo in all places of the Prophecy, for ought I ≈øee yet to the contrary) nor the opening of the Seals to ≈øigure any thing here, tho it be never us'd but figuratively in any other place? But la≈øtly, If the Hymn ≈øaid by every Creature, <hi>Rev.</hi> v. 13. and that by the Bea≈øts and Elders, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. be not to be ≈øung till the <hi>Millennium;</hi> it is certain from the unque≈øtionable Order of the Relation, that the Seals are not to be open'd till then neither. For <hi>when</hi> (that is, ≈øoon after) <hi>the Lamb had taken the Book,</hi> that Hymn which was ≈øung by the Bea≈øts and Elders, is expre≈øly ≈øaid to have been ≈øung, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. And the Seals were not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by the Lamb, till he had taken the Book; therefore the opening of the Bock was to be much about the ≈øame time with the Song ≈øung by the Bea≈øts and Elders, and cannot by any means be thought to have been fulfill'd 1600 Years before it. Whence it follows, That that Phra≈øe of opening the Book cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood literally, <hi>i. e.</hi> it can't be under≈øtood to ≈øignify no more, than what was done in the Vi≈øion pre≈øented to St. <hi>John</hi> 1600 Years ago. And thus much to prove that by opening the Sealed Book, <hi>Rev.</hi> v. is meant explaining it.</p>
            <p>As to the other Point, <hi>viz.</hi> That by the Throne in the Vi≈øion I am upon, is meant a Throne of God upon Earth; becau≈øe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring the proof of it within the compa≈øs of this Sheet of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, I re≈øerve it to another, if God permit. Tho it may ≈øeem to be prov'd already, in that, 1. The Throne is plainly one of tho≈øe things which the Spirit expre≈øly calls things future, <hi>Rev.</hi> iv. 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c. Come up hither</hi> (≈øays the Voice) <hi>and I will ≈øhew thee things that mu≈øt be herca≈øter</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> things which are not yet in being; much le≈øs things which have been the ≈øame from all Eternity.) <hi>And immediately</hi> (≈øays the Prophet, as the re≈øult of the Voice's calling to him) <hi>I was
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29464:11"/>in the Spirit, and behold, a Throne was ≈øet in Heaven, and one ≈øat upon it.</hi> Wherefore ≈øince it is evident that this Throne was not in being at the time of the exhibiting of this Vi≈øion to St. <hi>John;</hi> what can be more plain, than that it is not the Throne of God in the highe≈øt Heaven? 2. If by opening the Seals, be meant explaining the Book to the People of God (as I have prov'd it is) then it mu≈øt needs follow, that the Lamb with ≈øeven Horns and ≈øeven Eyes, that opens the Book, is not Chri≈øt him≈øelf in Per≈øon, but the Church of Chri≈øt (as the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. 14. is expounded, <hi>Rev.</hi> xiii. 7. and even by rea≈øon it ≈øelf.) For ≈øince the time of his conver≈øing with us in the Fle≈øh, we are not to expect that he ≈øhould come in Per≈øon to explain any Book to us. And con≈øequently the Throne, in the middle of which the Lamb is repre≈øented, is ≈øome earthly Throne.</p>
            <div type="corollary">
               <head>A Corollary.</head>
               <p>If by opening the Book, <hi>Rev.</hi> v. be meant explaining it; then mo≈øt certain it is, That the time of the Church prefigur'd in that Chapter, is that wherein the Book we ≈øpeak of, has been or ≈øhall be <hi>fir≈øt</hi> explain'd. For whereas it is ≈øaid, That upon Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made, no Man in the World could explain it, <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3. and when St. <hi>John</hi> wept becau≈øe no body was found able, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently thereupon an Elder is repre≈øented as comforting him with the joyful News of the unfolding of it, in the≈øe words, <hi>Weep not, Behold, the Lion of the Tribe of</hi> Judah, <hi>the Root of</hi> David <hi>hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed to open the Book,</hi> v. 5. As who ≈øhould ≈øay, Behold, through the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of Chri≈øt, who≈øe Merits are ever prevalent with God for the good of his Church, I have ≈øet forth an Explication of it. Whence it undeniably follows, That the time of the Church pre≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur'd in that Chapter, is the very time wherein it would plea≈øe that Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> to impart the fir≈øt true Expo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Book to his People. And the Book is the ≈øame which the Lamb takes, <hi>Chap.</hi> v. 7. and opens, <hi>Chap.</hi> vi. where al≈øo the Contents of it are particularly rehear≈øed. If therefore that Book be truly expounded (as no doubt it is) already; then is the time prefigur'd in <hi>Rev.</hi> v. 5. pa≈øt. And the Per≈øon that has done it (being one of the four and twenty Elders) was a Member of that glorious Church de≈øcrib'd, <hi>Chap.</hi> iv. 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that that Church, or ≈øtate of the Church, mu≈øt needs be come al≈øo: which Ob≈øervation will be of great u≈øe to us, when we come to the particular Explication of the Prophecy.</p>

            <head>III. <hi>More Arguments to ≈øhew, That by the</hi> Throne, Rev. iv. &amp; v. <hi>is meant a Throne of God on</hi> Earth, <hi>and not in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt</hi> Heaven. <hi>With An≈øwers to Objections.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>TO the two Arguments made u≈øe of in the former Sheet, to prove that by the Throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> iv, &amp; v. is meant ≈øome Throne of God on Earth, and not in the highe≈øt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; I now add,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That it is certain, and confe≈øt by all Interpreters, that by Heaven in ≈øome places of the <hi>Revelation</hi> (as al≈øo in other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of Scripture) is meant an Heaven upon Earth. As in <hi>Rev.</hi> xii. where we have mention of a Woman in Heaven, and of a great Red Dragon there al≈øo per≈øecuting her (which Dragon is call'd, at <hi>ver.</hi> 9. the Devil and Satan) and the Woman afterwards flying into the Wilderne≈øs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Who can be ≈øo ≈øen≈øle≈øs as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret this Heaven, otherwi≈øe than of an Heaven upon Earth, where the Woman (the Church) is per≈øecuted by her profe≈øt Enemy the Devil? Since therefore it is ≈øo demon≈øtrably certain, that in this Prophecy, Heaven is ≈øometimes taken for an Heaven upon Earth; and it cannot be made out clearly, that Heaven, where it is ≈øpoken of as the Scene of any Action, is ever u≈øed there in any other ≈øen≈øe; it follows, that the Heaven we ≈øpeak of, <hi>Rev.</hi> iv, &amp; v. is an Heaven upon Earth too; and con≈øequently the Throne there ≈øpoken of, an Earthly Throne. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If it could be made appear, that Heaven, where it is made the Scene of Action, is any where us'd in this Prophecy for the highe≈øt Heaven: Yet here it were a mo≈øt unrea≈øonable thing to take it in that ≈øen≈øe. For then the Sitter on the Throne, with the Book ≈øealed in his Right Hand, <hi>Rev.</hi> v. 1. mu≈øt be God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And whereas it is ≈øaid in the next Ver≈øe, that Proclamation was made by a ≈øtrong Angel, <hi>Who is worthy to open the Book?</hi> &amp;c. In the 3d Ver≈øe, it is return'd thereupon, <hi>That no Man in Heaven, nor in Earth, neither under the Earth, was able to open the Book, neither to look thereon.</hi> The meaning of which (if by Heaven be meant the highe≈øt Heaven) mu≈øt be, That Chri≈øt him≈øelf was not able
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29464:12"/>to open the Book, neither to look thereon; which were mo≈øt ab≈øurd. And the more, becau≈øe it is certain, that God had given his Son the Revelation, (whereof the Book we ≈øpeak of is confe≈øt to be a part) before ever this Vi≈øion was exhibited to St. <hi>John.</hi> For Chri≈øt would not have ≈øent his Angel to ≈øignify it to his Servant <hi>John, Rev.</hi> i. 1. if God had not ≈øignified it to Chri≈øt before. Wherefore when it is ≈øaid; <hi>That no Man in Heaven was able to open the Book;</hi> the meaning cannot be, that no Man in the highe≈øt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where Chri≈øt ≈øitteth at the Right Hand of God, was able; but it mu≈øt be expounded (as it is certain that it ought in other places) of an Heaven upon Earth.</p>
            <p>To this the Doctor an≈øwers, That Chri≈øt is excepted; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as is an≈øwered by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in a like Ca≈øe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 27. But I reply, That let the Doctor under≈øtand it how he plea≈øes, it is certain that St. <hi>John</hi> did not under≈øtand it with exception of Chri≈øt, <hi>viz.</hi> as if it had been ≈øaid, No Man in Heaven, but Chri≈øt, was able to open the Book. And this appears from what follows in the iv. <hi>ver.</hi> where St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>He wept much, becau≈øe no Man was found worthy to open and read the Book, neither to look thereon.</hi> For if the Sitter on the Throne were God Almighty on the Throne of Glory, with a Book in his Right Hand ≈øealed, how odly would it have look'd in St. <hi>John</hi> to weep, and that much, becau≈øe no Man but Chri≈øt was found worthy to open it? For whom could he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect or de≈øire ≈øhould do it be≈øides? But the Doctor adds (<hi>Par. Proph. Chap.</hi> xxxiv. <hi>re≈øp. ad</hi> 5.) That St. <hi>John</hi> did not know as yet, that Chri≈øt was worthy to open the Book and read it, nor ≈øo much as to look upon it. <hi>Repl.</hi> I wonder the Doctor ≈øhould ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ≈øay ≈øo! For this is to make that great Apo≈øtle, and beloved Di≈øciple, a very ignorant Man indeed. For did not St. <hi>John</hi> know the Worthine≈øs and Abilities of Chri≈øt, as well as any Man? The Prophet had cau≈øe to weep then indeed, if he were ≈øo weak as to think that Chri≈øt him≈øelf was not worthy to read the Book. But how could he be ignorant of that, which every Chri≈øtian is ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to know? Be≈øides, St. <hi>John</hi> mu≈øt needs have known what the Book was, or el≈øe he would not have wept that no Man could open it. But it is confe≈øt on all hands, that the Book was part of the Revelation. So that St. <hi>John</hi> of all Men could not be ignorant of Chri≈øt's Worthine≈øs to open the Book, when he knew that Chri≈øt had call'd him on purpo≈øe to communicate it to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But if St. <hi>John</hi>'s ignorance of Chri≈øt's Worthine≈øs had not been the cau≈øe of his Weeping, how comes the Elder, <hi>ver.</hi> v.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29464:12"/>to comfort him in the≈øe words; <hi>Weep not; behold, the Lion of the Tribe of</hi> Judah, <hi>the Root of</hi> David <hi>hath prevailed to open the Book?</hi> &amp;c. For by this it ≈øhould ≈øeem that St. <hi>John</hi> did not know that Chri≈øt could do it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> I have before prov'd this Vi≈øion to be a Prophecy, and that by <hi>Opening</hi> the Book, is prefigur'd the <hi>Explaining</hi> of it. So that the meaning of the Elder's words is plainly this: Not that Chri≈øt in his own Per≈øon hath given out an Expo≈øition of the Book, but that ≈øome Member of his Church on Earth hath done it, through the prevalence of his Interce≈ø≈øion. As if the Elder had ≈øaid, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I, through the Merits of Chri≈øt, have been enabled to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Book. So that the true rea≈øon of St. <hi>John</hi>'s weeping was, becau≈øe no Man in this World was found at that time worthy to open the Book; and therefore Chri≈øt is not excepted, becau≈øe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, as being not in this World. And thus are tho≈øe great Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurdities ea≈øily avoided, which mu≈øt needs follow upon making the Sitter on the Throne to be God Almighty; and the Heaven here ≈øpoken of, the highe≈øt Heaven; which can by no means be allow'd to be the ≈øen≈øe of this Prophecy.</p>

The Sitter on the Throne appears to be a Man, and not God in his own Per≈øon, from the de≈øcription that is given of him, <hi>Rev.</hi> iv. 3. where he is ≈øaid to be to look on like a Ja≈øper and a Sardine Stone; whereas God Almighty in his own Per≈øon, no Man hath ≈øeen at any time, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> vi. 16.) nor can ≈øee. Is it not therefore very ab≈øurd, to imagine the Invi≈øible God to be de≈øcrib'd, by telling us what He looks like? But now, if we conceive the Sitter on the Throne to be ≈øome Repre≈øentative of God (as a King, or the like) it would be very proper to de≈øcribe him by the likene≈øs of his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; and to ≈øay that ≈øuch an one was to look on like a Ja≈øper and a Sardine Stone, would be the propere≈øt De≈øcription of any. For as much as ≈øuch Per≈øons are wont to appear upon their Thrones in ≈øuch Ornaments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> That Hymn, <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,</hi> &amp;c. cannot be ≈øung to any Creature, which yet is ≈øung to the Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on the Throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> iv. 8. Al≈øo the Sitter on the Throne is ≈øaid <hi>to Live for ever and ever;</hi> and ≈øuch Wor≈øhip and Adoration is paid to him, as cannot be given to a Creature without Idolatry. To this purpo≈øe it is Objected by the Doctor, in the xxxiii. Chap. of his <hi>Paralipom. Prophetica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I an≈øwer, It is a mi≈øtake in the Doctor, to ≈øay that that Hymn, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is ≈øaid to be directed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29464:13"/>to the Sitter on the Throne: Whereas the Text it ≈øelf has only the≈øe words, <hi>And they re≈øt not day and night, ≈øaying,</hi> (without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øing to whom 'tis ≈øaid, leaving us thereby to under≈øtand that it is ≈øaid only to the B. Trinity) <hi>Holy, holy, holy,</hi> &amp;c. The next Ver≈øe indeed makes mention of giving Glory to the Sitter on the Throne; but then the words of that Doxology, are only the≈øe: <hi>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive Glory, and Honour, and Power; for thou ha≈øt Created all things, and for thy Plea≈øure they are, and were Created,</hi> Rev. iv. 11.</p>
            <p>But is it lawful then to u≈øe ≈øuch Expre≈ø≈øions as the≈øe to any Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentative of God? <hi>An≈øw.</hi> It is as lawful to u≈øe them to a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentative of God, as to u≈øe them to a God that looks like a Ja≈øper and a Sardine Stone. For can any thing that in its own Nature and Per≈øon looks like a Ja≈øper and a Sardine Stone, be the God that liveth for ever and ever, in a proper literal ≈øen≈øe? And there is an improper Analogical Sen≈øe, wherein a King may be ≈øaid to live for ever and ever, as well as a Man may be call'd Good, or Wi≈øe, or Holy. For we know our Saviour ≈øays expre≈øly, that <hi>there is none good but God;</hi> and yet in a re≈øerv'd ≈øen≈øe, we commonly call Men good too, without any offence or fault at all. The like may be ≈øaid of calling Men wi≈øe, and holy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And why may not as well the title of <hi>Living for ever and ever,</hi> be attributed to a King? For it is certain, that there is or ≈øhall be a Kingdom in this World, that ≈øhall la≈øt for ever and ever, <hi>Dan.</hi> ii. 44. &amp; vii. 27. <hi>Rev.</hi> xi. 15. &amp; xxii. 5. And it is as certain, that the ≈øeveral Kings of any Kingdom ruling ≈øucce≈ø≈øively one after another, are repre≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Prophecy but as one King; as may be ≈øeen in many places of the viii. Chap. of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and in <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is confe≈øt by all Interpreters. Whence it follows, that as the Kingdom it ≈øelf is ≈øaid to continue for ever, ≈øo the King of it may as well be ≈øaid to live for ever; in what ≈øen≈øe the one may be ≈øaid, the other may be ≈øaid al≈øo. But here it is to be ob≈øerv'd yet farther, that I do not ≈øay that the Sitter on the Throne is not God, but that it is not God in his own Per≈øon, but de≈øcrib'd according as He is pleas'd to exhibit him≈øelf glorious in ≈øome Earthly Prince. As when, with re≈øpect to his delivering his People out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> God is de≈øcrib'd as having a mighty Hand, and a ≈øtretched-out Arm; not that God in his own Per≈øon has any bodily Parts, but this is ≈øpoken with re≈øpect to <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> who≈øe Hand and Arm God made u≈øe of in that Work, making his Hand Mighty, and the ≈øtretching-out of his Arm to do Wonders. So that in effect, the Sitter on the Throne is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29464:13"/>God and the King too, or God working in and by the King, who is here con≈øider'd only as God's In≈øtrument in the Work, for which thanks is given to them both as one, in being given to the Sitter on the Throne. Wherefore the Doxology given to the Sitter on the Throne, (together with the other expre≈ø≈øions of Devotion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with mentioned) is ≈øo to be under≈øtood as being only by Analogy or My≈øtery applicable to the Vi≈øible Sitter that look'd like a Ja≈øper and a Sardine Stone; but properly and literally to God Almighty the Invi≈øible <hi>Co-≈øe≈ø≈øor</hi> and Director of him.</p>
            <p>But the Doctor further urges in the place afore-quoted, that there is no ground for making two Sitters on the Throne. <hi>An≈øw.</hi> If there be ground for making the Sitter on the Throne a good King, there mu≈øt be the ≈øame for making God to ≈øit with him, by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øible A≈ø≈øi≈øtance and Direction. So that in making the Sitter on the Throne to be a King directed by God ≈øitting with him, I make indeed no more than one Sitter on the Throne; according as <hi>One</hi> is taken in the holy Scriptures ≈øive hundred times, as where we are forbidden to have more Ma≈øters than One, and the like. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if the Spirit has vouch≈øafed to ≈øay of every ordinary Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that he is one with God and Chri≈øt: How glorious and indi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoluble is the Union between God and a good King, whom he vouch≈øafes to make his In≈øtrument in the Delivering or Protecting of his Church? So that the making of God and the King to be the Sitter on the Throne, is ≈øo far from making two Sitters, that he could not be a good King, unle≈øs God were ≈øuppos'd to ≈øit with him.</p>
            <p>But were it not Idolatry in People to wor≈øhip God by any Vi≈øible Repre≈øentative of his, ≈øitting in the mid≈øt of them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the de≈øcription in <hi>Rev.</hi> iv. where is one ≈øitting vi≈øibly in the mid≈øt of the Throne, with four <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, (or living Creatures) and twenty four Elders round about him? <hi>An≈øw.</hi> As to the Vi≈øion, there can be no Idolatry in that, becau≈øe it is but a Vi≈øion, and no real thing. And as to the Completion of it, we mu≈øt not think that the Prophecy is to be under≈øtood in that gro≈øs manner, as if it were never to be fulfill'd, till the Per≈øons ≈øignified by the Living Creatures and Elders ≈øhould get together about a Throne, paying their mo≈øt profound Devotions to one looking like a Ja≈øper and a Sardine Stone, ≈øitting in the mid≈øt of it. But the meaning is only to ≈øhew the Order of the Hierarchy, the Per≈øon ≈øitting in the mid≈øt of the Throne, being the Supreme Vi≈øible Governour; the Living Creatures in the mid≈øt of the Throne, and round about the Throne, next under him; and the 24 Elders under them. In which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29464:14"/>Order (not Local, but Political) or Subordination one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Inferiours pay their duties to their Superiour, and all of them to that good God, who invi≈øibly pre≈øides in the mid≈øt of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But the Doxology we ≈øpeak of, <hi>Rev.</hi> iv. 11. is addre≈øt to the Sitter on the Throne for his <hi>Creating of all things,</hi> and how then could any Mortal have an hand with him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> In the Language of the Prophets, any notable alteration of Affairs, is call'd a New Creation. And as for the term of <hi>all things,</hi> it is very often ≈øaid not of

            <p n="6">6. The Throne appears to be an Earthly Throne al≈øo, by the Company that are gather'd about it. For the≈øe are call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, Living Creatures, and Elders; which are Names we never find given to any but Mortals. And it is a very dangerous thing, for the ≈øake of an Hypothe≈øis, and to ≈øerve a Turn, to depart from the con≈øtant and unque≈øtionable u≈øe of Words, by affixing private and unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Interpretations to them. The≈øe Per≈øons are al≈øo prov'd to be Mortals, by the Incen≈øe they are repre≈øented with, <hi>Rev.</hi> v. 8. which is a Type of the a≈øcending up of the Prayers of the Church from Earth to Heaven. From whence Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> upon the place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, that the Per≈øons u≈øing it, are the Church on Earth. And he infers the like from what they ≈øay of them≈øelves, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. that they were <hi>made to God Kings and Prie≈øts, and that they ≈øhould reign upon the Earth.</hi> For this de≈øcription can neither agree to Angels, nor to Souls departed. But if the Company about the Throne be Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, the Throne mu≈øt needs be an Earthly Throne. And ≈øince mention has been made of the Famous and Learned Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> I crave leave to add, That he is ≈øo far from ≈øcrupling to interpret the Sitter on the Throne to be a Man, that he makes him not ≈øo much as a King, but only a Bi≈øhop. For which, ≈øee his Annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on <hi>Rev.</hi> iv. 2. and I look upon Dr. <hi>Hammand</hi> to be as good a Judg as any Man of what Interpretations are <hi>≈øafe,</hi> tho' not ≈øo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of what are <hi>≈øound.</hi> But to return to our purpo≈øe,</p>
            <p n="7">7. The <hi>New Jeru≈øalem</hi> is a City that was to be on Earth, as appears from <hi>Rev.</hi> xxi. 2. where it is ≈øaid to come down from God out of Heaven. The ≈øame is ≈øaid of it again at <hi>ver.</hi> 10. where al≈øo St. <hi>John</hi> is carried up but to an high Mountain to ≈øee it; ≈øo that it mu≈øt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:29464:14"/>needs be an Earthly City: And if it came down from God out of Heaven (as is ≈øaid of it) whither could it come but to the Earth? Accordingly we find it ≈øaid at <hi>ver.</hi> 24. That <hi>the Kings of the Earth do bring their Glory and Honour into it.</hi> And at ver. 26. <hi>They ≈øhall bring the Glory and Honour of the Nations into it:</hi> From whence it is very plain, that the <hi>New Jeru≈øalem</hi> was to be a City on Earth. But now, in <hi>Rev.</hi> xxii. 3. The Throne of God and the Lamb is ≈øaid to be in the <hi>New Jeru≈øalem;</hi> which Throne of God and the Lamb, is the ≈øame with that we are ≈øpeaking of, as will appear from <hi>Rev.</hi> v. 6. where the Lamb is repre≈øented in the mid≈øt of it. And therefore the Throne we ≈øpeak of is an Earthly Throne, as being in an Earthly City.</p>
            <p n="8">8. La≈øtly, For fail, Dr. <hi>M.</hi> him≈øelf, again≈øt whom I unwillingly di≈øpute all this while, confe≈ø≈øes the 24 Elders to be a Type of our Noble Reformers, <hi>i.e.</hi> of Mortals: See his <hi>Apoc. Apocalyp≈øeos</hi> upon <hi>Rev.</hi> xi. 16. whence it follows, That the Throne about which they are repre≈øented in the Vi≈øion, mu≈øt be a Type of an Earthly Throne. Nay, and even this the Doctor has a≈ø≈øerted too (tho he now ≈øeem to have forgotten it) or el≈øe what mean tho≈øe words of his upon <hi>Rev.</hi> vii. 9. <hi>After this I beheld, and lo, a great multitude which no Man could number, of all Nations, and Kindreds, and People, and Tongues, ≈øtood before the Throne, and before the Lamb.</hi> Namely (≈øays the Doctor) before the Throne above (<hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> iv. &amp; v.) de≈øcribed in Heaven: <hi>For</hi> John (he adds) <hi>is ≈øuppo≈øed to ≈øee all the≈øe Vi≈øions in Heaven, tho they concern things here on Earth.</hi> Of which words, the plain meaning is, That altho the Vi≈øion repre≈øents the≈øe things in Heaven, yet they are to be fulfill'd in things on Earth. And what is this but to grant, that the Throne ≈øeen in Heaven in the Type, is in the Antitype an Earthly Throne? And ≈øo much for proof, that by the Throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> iv. &amp; v. is meant an Earthly Throne.</p>
            <p>I ≈øhall therefore conclude this Point with a further Illu≈øtration of it, taken from that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, which is ea≈øie to be ob≈øerv'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Sitter on the Throne we ≈øpeak of, and the Dragon with Seven Heads and Ten Horns, de≈øcribed <hi>Rev.</hi> xii. Concerning which Dragon, it is confe≈øt by Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> Dr. <hi>More,</hi> and all the be≈øt Interpreters, that thereby are meant the Pagan Per≈øecuting Emperours of <hi>Rome,</hi> the profe≈øt Enemies and Oppo≈øers of the Church of Chri≈øt. Notwith≈øtanding which con≈øent of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the Holy Spirit him≈øelf tells us, at <hi>ver.</hi> 9. that this Dragon is the Devil and Satan. And yet the Prophecy mentions but one ≈øuch Seven-headed Dragon neither. So that it mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29464:15"/>follow, according to them, (and indeed according to the truth it ≈øelf) that by the Dragon is repre≈øented both the Pagan Emperours as In≈øtruments, and Satan as the prime mover of them, by who≈øe In≈øtigation and A≈ø≈øi≈øtance, they became ≈øo active in endeavouring the Churches Ruine: The Emperours were the vi≈øible Dragon, actuated and ≈øet on work by Satan the invi≈øible.</p>
            <p>The Reddition or Application of this to the Sitter on the Throne, is obvious. For by Interpreting the Sitter on the Throne to be a King, (notwith≈øtanding that the Prophecy ≈øets him forth as God) I do no more make two Sitters on the Throne, then they who expound the Dragon to be a King (notwith≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he is ≈øaid to be the Devil) make two Dragons. And as the things ≈øpoken of the Dragon there, are applicable to Satan as the prime Mover, but to the Emperours as his In≈øtruments; ≈øo the things ≈øpoken of the Sitter on the Throne, are applicable to God as the fir≈øt and principal Cau≈øe of all, and to Men employed by him in the Service, only as In≈øtruments and ≈øecond Cau≈øes. And I would fain know whether the nature of the oppo≈øite Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that there is between two Princes, the one a violent Per≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor and profe≈øt Enemy of the Church, and the other as zealous a Defender of it, do not oblige, that as the one is repre≈øented like the Devil and Satan, who≈øe work he does; ≈øo the other ≈øhould be repre≈øented like God, who≈øe Image, In≈øtrument and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentative on Earth he is. According as we find Interpreters to agree in the Expo≈øition of the Man-child, ≈øaid to be caught up to God, and to his Throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> xii. 5. for they expound it generally of <hi>Con≈øtantine</hi> the Great (as I took notice before.) And if other Scriptures are found to flie ≈øo high in the ≈øetting forth of Kings, as to call them Gods; much more may we expect them to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcrib'd as ≈øuch in this Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which mu≈øt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øt for loftine≈øs of Expre≈ø≈øion, to exceed all others in the Sacred Volume.</p>
